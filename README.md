# Kubernetes Platform

This repository contains the base Kubernetes configuration used to set up and structure the platform.

## What is this?

The goal of this project is to define the foundations of a Kubernetes environment:
- namespaces to organize the cluster
- basic access rules
- resource limits to keep things under control

This repository focuses on the platform itself, not on applications.

## What’s inside?

You will find Kubernetes manifests that define:
- the main platform namespace
- security rules (RBAC)
- default resource limits and quotas

## Status

This project is a work in progress and will evolve step by step.
